check in salary slip uan number

last time On August 25 i filled up form of "PF & ESIC Details Form"  so why my PF account didn't generate yet


Basic Salary    9000.00   | Professional tax                      150.00
HRA (AMT)        607.00   | PF Employee Contribution (12.00%)   1,080.00
               ---------  | ESIC Employee Contribution (0.75%)      0.00
Total Earnings 9,607.00   |                                    --------- 
                                           Total Deduction      1,230.00

that means




why showing me Basic Salary 9000 instead of 11000
and PF & PT are deducate from the basic salary of 9000

          My CTC is                11000.00
employer PF Contribution         - 1,080.00         	 	     
employer ESIC Contribution       -   313.00
Professional Tax                 -   150.00
                                 ------------
My Salary be after all deducation  9,457.00rs  


instead of getting 9,457.00rs what i am actually getting 9,607.00rs

from the  9,607.00 why PF, ESIC is deducated again ?
which i acually paid for PF, ESIC & PT ?
